			I am a lecturer in the Stanford Computer Science Department.Before coming to Stanford,I spent two years as a <BR />
			programmer at Taligent(now part of IBM).At Taligent,I worked on Places for Project Teams,a groupware product <BR />
			designed to improve communication and coordination within small project teams.I was fortunate to work with the Places for <BR />
			Project Teams product throughout an entire software life cycle-from initial product conception through the actual product<BR />
			launch.
			<BR /><BR />
			I have a Ph.D. from the University of California,Irvine,where I specialized in Software Engineering.My dissertation was on <BR />
			process support for software engineering teams.I also have a masters degree from Irvine,with a specialization in Artificial <BR />
			Intelligence,and bachelors degrees in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering.
